Sorry! Board Game Simulation

This project is a simulation of a simplified version of the board game Sorry!, and is designed so that the simulation can
used to run experiments. In Sorry!, there are four players each having four pawns and at the start of each turn, the
player picks a card which will tell the player how many spaces they can move a pawn. It is the player's discretion on
which pawn they would like to move. However, in this simulation, for three out of the four players, the decision on which
pawn to move is randomized. 

The particular experiment this simulation is used to test is to decide whether moving all of the pawns out of the 
start zone first or moving one pawn at a time until they reached home was more advantageous. To do this, three players
would be moving their pawns at random while one player is playing with one of two strategies. The first strategy moves all of
that player's pawns out onto the board before moving further. The second strategy has one pawn on the board at a time and 
does not move any other pawns until the pawn before it reaches the home zone.
